Simple weather app with openweathermap API using HTML CSS and JavaScript.
Generated an API key from openweathermap to use in the JS.
I initaited a fetch request using the fetch method on the API calls and a promise was returned on the response object.
I parsed the data from the response using JSON and displayed it for the various weather sections. I also added error messages in case there was any error while fetching the data.
then I separated the hourlyForecast data into 3 hours using 8 intervals.
I used a forEach loop to run through the intervals creating html elements for each and appending the results to the original hourlyForecast.
